yield: 12
prepTime: "20 Minutes"
cookTime: "15 Minutes (+ 30 Minute chill)"

ingredients:
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar (100 g)
- 3/4 cup brown sugar (165 g), packed
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter (115 g), melted
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (155 g)
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks (110 g)
- 4 oz dark chocolate chunk (110 g), or your preference

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). 
- In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
- Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
- Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).
- Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
- Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.
- Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.
- Cool completely before serving.
