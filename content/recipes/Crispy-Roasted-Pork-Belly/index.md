yield: 8
prepTime: "20 Minutes"
cookTime: "1 Hour 30 minutes"

ingredients:
  - 2 lbs pork belly slab
  - 2 pieces fermented red bean curd
  - ½ teaspoon black pepper
  - ½ teaspoon five spice powder
  - ½ tsp sugar
  - ¼ teaspoon salt
  - 1 tsp soy sauce
  - 1 tsp rice wine
  - Enough salt to cover the skin of the pork

directions:
  - Poke holes into the meat side of the pork belly with a fork and score the skin side of the pork belly with a sharp knife.
  - Mix together bean curd, pepper, five spice powder, sugar, salt, soy sauce and rice wine to form a thin paste. Rub into meat side of pork belly
  - Place pork belly in a tray skin side up. Wipe off any marinade that may have gotten on the skin. Refrigerate overnight at least 8 hours but up to 24
  - Preheat oven to 400 degrees once ready to roast.
  - Let meat sit and come to room temp before roasting. Cover skin with layer of salt about ¼ inch thick.
  - Place pork on a wire rack atop a lined baking sheet. Add warm water to the tray before roasting to keep the meat moist. Roast in the middle rack of the oven, about 45 minutes or until the salt has turned golden brown and started curling up at the edges.
  - Take pork out and remove salt layer with an offset spatula or knife. Return to oven on top shelf to let skin bubble up and crisp, about 45 minutes.
  - If skin is crisping unevenly or starts to burn, cover those areas with foil and continue to bake
  - Use the broiler for 2-3 minutes as necessary to get an even crisp on the skin
  - Let meat rest for 20-30 minutes before slicing
