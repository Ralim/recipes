cookTime: "30 Minutes"

ingredients:
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 packet beef strips
- 1 red onion
- 2 packet crispy shallots
- 2 carrots
- 2 bags cos lettuce
- 1 packet garlic aioli
- 12 mini tortillas
- 4 tbs soy sauce
- 1/2 cup vingar (rice wine, white wine)
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tbs olive oil
- 2 tbs honey
- 1/2 cup water
- 6 tsp sugar
directions:
- Finely chop the garlic (or use a garlic press). In a medium bowl, combine the garlic, soy sauce and honey. 
- Add the beef strips, toss to coat and set aside to marinate. TIP; If you have time, let the beef marinate for at least 15 minutes to enhance the flavour and increase tenderness.
- While the beef is marinating, thinly slice the red onion. In a small bowl, combine the vinegar, water, the salt and sugar. Scrunch the onion in your hands, then add to the pickling liquid and stir to coat. Set aside until just before serving.
- While the onion is pickling, grate the carrot (unpeeled). Shred the cos lettuce. Thinly slice the long red chilli (if using). In a second medium bowl, combine the carrot, lettuce and chilli (if using). Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and toss to coat. Set aside.
- In a medium frying pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat. When the oil is hot, add 1/2 the beef strips and cook, tossing, until browned and cooked through, 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining beef strips. 
- While the beef is cooking, heat the mini flour tortillas in a sandwich press, or on a plate in the microwave for 10 second bursts, until warmed through.
- Take everything to the table to serve. Just before serving, drain the pickled onion. Top the tortillas with the salad, Korean beef and quick pickled onion. Add a dollop of garlic aioli and sprinkle with the crispy shallots.
