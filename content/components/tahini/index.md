ingredients:
- 1 cup hulled sesame seeds
- 2 to 4 tablespoons neutral flavored oil such as grape seed, canola or a light olive oil
- Pinch of salt, optional

directions:
- Add sesame seeds to a wide, dry saucepan over medium-low heat and toast, stirring constantly until the seeds become fragrant and very lightly colored (not brown), 3 to 5 minutes. 
- Transfer toasted seeds to a baking sheet or large plate and cool completely. (Careful here, sesame seeds can burn quickly).
- Add sesame seeds to the bowl of a food processor then process until a crumbly paste forms, about 1 minute. 
- Add 3 tablespoons of the oil then process for 2 to 3 minutes more, stopping to scrape the bottom and sides of the food processor a couple times.
- Check the tahini’s consistency. It should be smooth, not gritty and should be pourable. You may need to process for another minute or add the additional tablespoon of oil. 
- Taste the tahini for seasoning then add salt to taste. Process 5 to 10 seconds to mix it in.
- Store tahini covered in the refrigerator for one month. You may notice it separates over time, like a natural peanut butter would. If this happens, give the tahini a good stir before using.
